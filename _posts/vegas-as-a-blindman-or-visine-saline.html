<p>I've been asked by a few people about the time that I was <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/bhudgeons/status/163715178775588864">blind in Vegas</a>. &nbsp;So, here's the story:</p>
<p>In 1999, I was working for <a href="http://motive.com/">Motive Communications</a>. &nbsp;They sent me to CES in Vegas to make contacts and report back on the state of software for set-top-boxes, one of our target platforms. &nbsp;After a full day of stomping the convention floor, I played a bit of blackjack, and then headed back to my room so I could be coherent for the next day's meetings.</p>
<p>I discovered that I had forgotten the saline solution to store my contacts, as well as my glasses, so I headed back down to the hotel gift shop to buy some. &nbsp;They didn't have saline, but they did have Visine. &nbsp;Seemed like a reasonable substitute to me. &nbsp;I bought some, filled my contact lens case with Visine, and went to sleep.</p>
<p>The next morning, I was running a bit late for my first meeting. &nbsp;I dressed in a hurry and popped in my contact lenses. &nbsp;I got the second one in before the searing pain started in the first eye. &nbsp;The second eye started burning as I scrambled to get the first one out. &nbsp;I considered my options: &nbsp;I could go through the day without glasses or contacts and still be able to read and take notes, but losing my distance vision would be a bad thing at a conference -- slides would be completely unreadable. &nbsp;Instead, I rinsed the contacts as best I could under the tap water and put them back into my eyes. &nbsp;The pain continued for awhile, and then subsided to a mild burning sensation. &nbsp;But at least I could see.</p>
<p>I tromped off to the convention floor. &nbsp;People at the conference gave me good-natured jabs about my bloodshot eyes, assuming I had been out all night long (as many of them had). &nbsp;As the day wore on, the burning in my eyes gave way to a dull ache. &nbsp;The comments turned from, "Too much fun last night?" to "Wow, you must have really partied last night," to "Dude, what the fuck happened to your eyes?" &nbsp;Lights became increasingly unbearable, and I started staring at the floor. &nbsp;The dull ache turned into a throbbing pain. &nbsp;Finally, I went into a casino bathroom and looked in the mirror. &nbsp;Both of my eyes were a bright blood-red. &nbsp;I took out my contacts and threw them away, but the pain persisted. &nbsp;I found a bottle of saline solution at another gift shop and tried squirting it into my eyes to wash them out, but it didn't help. &nbsp;My eyes became so senstitive to light that it hurt to even open them. &nbsp;They were too teary to see anyway, and without my contacts, I was pretty much blind. &nbsp;I could squint through tears to see my feet on the floor and make sure I wasn't bumping into anybody, but that was it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought the darkest pair of sunglasses I could find, and then called Megan (my wife). &nbsp;She called an opthamologist friend. &nbsp;Their conversation went something like this:</p>
<p>"My husband is in Las Vegas. &nbsp;Last night, he didn't have saline to store his contacts, so he used Visine."</p>
<p>"Oh no."</p>
<p>"He's had them in for most of the day."</p>
<p>"Uuuuugh."</p>
<p>"He finally took them out and has been trying to rinse his eyes out, but they still hurt."</p>
<p>"That bonehead."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It turns out that the morning's initial searing pain was a chemical burn caused by holding the Visine against the surface of my eye. &nbsp;The chemical burn was burning away the outer layer of my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva">conjunctiva</a>, which (among other things) protects the eye from infection. &nbsp;Other than the pain and sensitivity, my eyes were now highly prone to infection. &nbsp;Wandering around casinos and sticking my fingers and Vegas tap water in my eyes was not, apparently, high on my opthamologist's list of recommended activities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought the darkest pair of sunglasses I could find in the casino gift shop, and Megan helped me book an earlier flight. &nbsp;For the rest of the day, I was pretty much blind -- I could squint through tears long enough to plan out about 10 steps without bumping into anyone or anything, but I had no distance vision and no ability to read anything. &nbsp;I managed to wander around long enough to find my baggage and a taxi to the airport. &nbsp;Kind strangers read the airport monitors for me and led me to my gate. &nbsp;Megan met me at the airport with antibiotic ointment for my eyes.</p>
<p>Luckily, I managed to avoid any permanent damage. &nbsp;As a matter of fact, other than having to continue use of the ointment for a bit longer, my eyes and vision felt completely normal just two days later.</p>
<p>Don't soak your contacts in Visine. &nbsp;Bonehead.</p>
